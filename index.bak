	<h2>What is "Text and Image Studies?"</h2>
<h3>  Text and Image Studies is about analyzing text and image. Text can be defined as a way in which people express themselves (including emotions, desires, message elements, and ideas), communicate with each other, record and connect; images refer to a way text is presented. Text and images constitute a sensational and imaginative world. A study in Text and Image Studies can be seen as perceiving life, experiencing life, and exploring the world.
	
  By exploring the connotations and externalities of texts and images, the scope of Text and Image Studies ranges from ancient art, comics, picture books, movies, commercials, posters, fashion apparel, the Internet, social media, and barrage videos. This includes their production mechanism, usage, evolution, communication channels, social networks, political appeal, consumer culture, visual thinking, aesthetic awareness, artistic realm, etc.
